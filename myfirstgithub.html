	<p> This article did a great job in investigative reporting into a music star's life. We often see quick takes on the lives of famous people. But I enjoyed the care that was brought into this deep dive. </p>

	<li><a href="https://medium.com/cuepoint/in-defense-of-ms-hill-6fa84ba81d63" target="_blank">Medium</a> - In Defense Of Ms. Hill</li>

<p> We often don't get to knoow artists' takes on other artists. It was great to read Talib give homage to Lauryn in written format and talk about the artist/fan dynamic. </p>

	<li><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121550/cornel-wests-rise-fall-our-most-exciting-black-scholar-ghost" target="_blank">The New Republic</a> - The Ghost of Cornel West</li>

	<p> Prior to reading this article, Cornel West could do no wrong in my eyes. This article helped me to inspect an iconic American figure with a more critical lens. </p>
